    <p>
      1. <b>Latitude/longitude</b>, including for days in port, show representative decimal positions for each day, as calculated by the Old Weather project's analysis program. As such, they differ by varying amounts from the positions recorded, usually at noon, in the log pages. In addition, some latitudes/longitudes have been amended in edited logs for errors in the logs, for errors in identifying locations by the analysis program, or simply for greater accuracy. In all cases, refer to the log-page scans for the positions as originally recorded. Not all log pages contain this information and the ships' positions have therefore often been estimated.</p>
    <p>
      2. <b>Full account of any day</b> is available by clicking on the link above that day. Any groups of links may refer to log book covers and introductory information; some may be blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. <b>Logbook events</b> have been formatted but <b> not </b>edited. <b>The quality and quantity of transcribed information therefore varies</b>, and may include up to 3 versions of the same data depending on the number of volunteers working on the originals.

<p class="noteToEditor">Note to Editor: 
This voyage was scanned twice and transcribed 6 times. The first scan
is very bleached-looking, showing the badly fading ink.  The second
scan shows enhanced photography and is much easier to read.  The
second scan was also much more difficult to find, being scattered in
4 different places within later logs.  I left both links in, IDing
the better duplicates, just to avoid getting lost putting it all
together.  The transcriptions for each date are all together, but
scrambled; they will each have to be put in order.</p>

<p>First
two hours of the watch the Greenland coast to N &amp; E plainly
visible for the first time in several days. The position of Wilcox
Head &amp; Devils Thumb as laid down on ~~ is about 15 miles to S of
its true position. At 1 Devils Thumb hove E 1/4 N (psc). Ships head
NExE. At 1 the loose pans around the ship having a confused motion in
all directions. Large floe came down pressing smaller pans against
ship rudder. Rudder sustained no damage but lug of iron stanchion for
leading block of wheel chains carried away. Hauled ships head around
more to E, which left her free from ice pressure. Ice in vicinity of
ship in large pans pressed together and moving with the tide to N &amp;
W. Ships drifting with the ice &amp; tide. Three whalers in sight
inshore of us close into the land. Arctic &amp; Wolf to S &amp; E
about half mile distant. Last hour of watch heavy fall of snow
shutting in all surrounding objects.</p>
<p>Loose
ice drifting to N. At 5.45 the Thetis attempted to force way through
ice to open water. Cast off and prepared to follow. Closed distance
from Thetis &amp; secured to ice at 6.30, having made about 1/3 of a
mile NE.</p>
<p>Ice
in small pans of loosening, moving South with ebb tide. At 10.30 got
under way &amp; followed in wake of the Thetis. Forced way through
small ice jams and entered large pond of clear water and steamed to
its southern(?) edge, making fast at 11.30, there being no open water
beyond. Ice broken up much inshore, but not enough to admit passage
of ship. Broken ice in sight to N as far as Red Head, and another
lead of broken ice extending in direction of Brown(?) Islands. ~~~
while under way about 2 miles in NNE direction. Scrubbed off ships
side.</p>
<p>At
1.30 Arctic &amp; Wolf got under way and steamed to S &amp; E for
leads inshore, afterwards turning &amp; steaming to N. At 2.00 Thetis
cast off and steamed through narrow leads, heavy loose ice, towards
Wilcox Head, this ship following. Progress slow owing to frequent
stopping to turn sharp corners or shove sheets out of the way.
General course SE. Distance about 2 miles. At close of watch Devils
Thumb bore SE 1/4 E. Duck Islands SW 1/4 W. Ships head S 1/4 W.
Steamers Arctic &amp; Wolf to NE distant about six miles.</p>
<p>Steaming
in wake of Thetis, the whalers Arctic &amp; Wolf ahead. Making good a
course of about NExN. At intervals passing through pan ice &amp; part
of the time in open leads. The ice very thick in places. The ice
appearing broken up into large pans in a space several miles in width
extending in NEly direction. Ice inshore appearing but little broken.
Greenland coast in plain sight.</p>
<p>Steaming
in wake of Thetis through large water spaces and occasionally through
close jams of broken ice. Ice heavy and in large pans. Making a
general course of NNE. Arctic &amp; Wolf ahead about 3 miles. No
other vessels in sight.</p>
